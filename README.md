# Pong
Simple 2D Pong Game made using SFML, my own "GameEngine SFML" library and the SFML port of Dear ImGui. 

Contains the classic Pong gameplay, currently with 2 AI players playing. The Max Score and Win Margin are changeable in the Game Menu before starting the game. 
Created using XCode 11.3.1 on MacOS Catalina 10.15.2

This is my most recent work as of 24/01/2020. My plan is to create a small library of games and applications using my GameEngine SFML library, 
which should also be found on my GitHub profile

Please excuse any rough code, this is still work in progress.
